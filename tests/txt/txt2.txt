Hello represents an ingenious integration of pretrained dense retrieval (DPR) and sequence-to-sequence models. The PROCESS, involves retrieving documents using DPR and subsequently transmitting them to a seq2seq model. Through a process of marginalization, these models then produce desired outputs.

The retriever and seq2seq modules commence their operations as pretrained models, and through a joint fine-tuning process, they adapt collaboratively, thus enhancing both retrieval and generation for specific downstream tasks.
